# FSWD-Capstone-Computer-Parts-IMS
The "Build an Integrated Management System for Organizing Computer Parts" project focuses on the development of a specialized software system designed to efficiently manage and organize computer components. 
This system aims to streamline the inventory process for items like CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and motherboards. 
Key features include real-time tracking of parts, categorization capabilities, and a user-friendly interface that allows for quick access and updates. 
The project will also integrate database management tools to handle large volumes of data and ensure accuracy and ease of retrieval. 
This software is intended to be a robust solution for IT departments, computer repair shops, and tech enthusiasts who require an organized approach to managing a diverse range of computer parts.

This project is still under development
